# ðŸš€ HazeCMS (front-end)

Welcome to the HazeCMS Front-end repository. 

This repository contains the frontend code for a flexible and lightweight Content Management System.

Haze Frontend part was built using Angular 16, RxJS, NgRX and Angular Material.

Haze Backend part was built with NodeJS.

This project is still quite small and build by one developer. But I hope to make it grow with the help of the community. Don't hesitate to [give your opinion or contribute](https://github.com/techfever-soft/hazecms-frontend/issues) on all the functionnalities !
